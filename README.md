# Accessing Webservices Tutorial for Bio Scientists
A starter tutorial for bio scientists and engineers to access web services.

## Introduction
One of the most frustrating things about domain specific research is adopting and developing your concepts leveraging existing tools and datasets.  This tutorial aims to give a general straight-forward tutorial by integrating a 3rd party REST API (BiGG) and combining the information from that service with other available data.

### General Concepts Covered in this Tutorial
If you are not familiar with the following concepts, it is highly suggested you take a few minutes a research them to get a general understanding:

0. Python programming language
1. REST (Representational State Transfer) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer](Wikipedia)
2. Webscraping [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping#Web_scraping](Wikipedia)
